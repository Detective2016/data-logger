## Part A
a. Based on the readings from the serial monitor, what is the range of the analog values being read? <br />
50 - 1023 <br />
b. How many bits of resolution does the analog to digital converter (ADC) on the Arduino have(hint: where might you look to find this sort of thing)? How many are you using with the range of values you're seeing? <br />
10 bit as it can display up to 1023 <br />

## Part B
1a. Describe the voltage change over the sensing range of the sensor. A sketch of voltage vs. distance would work also. Does it match up with what you expect from the datasheet? <br />

2a. Include your accelerometer read-out code in your write-up. <br />
